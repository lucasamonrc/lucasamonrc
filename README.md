Hello, there! I'm Lucas, and I'm a software engineer based in Austin, TX.

I'm also a husband, father, latter-day saint, gamer, and life-long learner.

I thrive on writing software that solves real problems for real people. I do my best work in fast-paced, cross-functional teams, and I like to own my projects end-to-end—design, implementation, debugging, and release. While I primarily enjoy product engineering, I’m also happy to tackle infrastructure or platform engineering challenges. In my experience, prioritizing simplicity over premature optimization/abstraction leads to better solutions for the problems users face today.

I’m very comfortable with TypeScript, C#, web servers, databases, queues, and building systems end-to-end. I’ve also written Go in production, though it’s not my comfort zone.

Places I've worked:

- Founding Engineer at [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id/) (feb 2023-jul 2025)
- Engineering Intern at [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) (may 2022-aug 2022)
- Programmer (Contractor) at [Utah County Gov](https://www.utahcounty.gov/) (jun 2020-aug 2021)
