Hello, there! I'm Lucas.

I work as software engineer at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com). Previously I was a founding engineer at [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id), and before that I was attending school at [BYU](https://byu.edu) in Provo, UT.

I like to [write](https://lucasacastro.com/writing) every now and then, and about once a year I give a [talk](https://lucasacastro.com/talks at a developer conference or local meetup.

You can find me here on GitHub, and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasamonrc).

### Contact

I enjoy meeting new people! You're always welcome to send me an email at [hello@lucasacastro.com](mailto:hello@lucasacastro.com). I like chatting about programming, games, parenthood, and religion. If you want to talk about something else, that's fine too!
