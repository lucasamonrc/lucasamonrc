I’m Lucas, a software developer based in Austin, TX. I’m also a husband, father, latter-day saint, and gamer.

I’m passionate about writing software that solves real problems for people and businesses. I do my best work in fast-paced, cross-functional teams, and I like to own my projects end-to-end—design, implementation, debugging, and release.

While the majority of my experience is in product engineering, I’m always happy to work on infrastructure or platform challenges.

I’m very comfortable programming with TypeScript, C#, Go, web servers, databases, queues, and building systems end-to-end.

Places I’ve worked:

- Systems Engineer at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) (jul 2025-present)
- Founding Engineer at [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id/) (feb 2023-jul 2025)
- Engineering Intern at [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) (may 2022-aug 2022)
- Programmer at [Utah County Gov](https://www.utahcounty.gov/) (jun 2020-aug 2021)
